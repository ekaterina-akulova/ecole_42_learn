Push_swap
Because Swap_push isn’t as natural

Summary:
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project:
data must be sorted.
You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions
to manipulate both stacks.
Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.

Easy?

We’ll see...

Writing a sorting algorithm is always a very important step in a developer’s journey. It
is often the first encounter with the concept of complexity.

Sorting algorithms and their complexity are part of the classic questions discussed
during job interviews. It’s probably a good time to look at these concepts since you’ll
have to face them at some point.

The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C, and use of basic algorithms.
Especially focusing on their complexity.

Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. 
Especially
because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting solution can
differ.



Common Instructions


• Your project must be written in C.

• Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus
files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there
is a norm error inside.

• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be
considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.

• All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks
will be tolerated.

• If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your
source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use
cc, and your Makefile must not relink.

• Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re.

• To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h} if
the subject does not specify anything else. Mandatory and bonus part evaluation
is done separately.

• If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your project’s
Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.

• We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.

• Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done

Push_swap Because Swap_push isn’t as natural
after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.
 
Mandatory part

V.1 The rules

• You have 2 stacks named a and b.

• At the beginning:

◦ The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers
which cannot be duplicated.

◦ The stack b is empty.

• The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
following operations at your disposal:

sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.

Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.

Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

ss : sa and sb at the same time.

pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
Do nothing if b is empty.

pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
Do nothing if a is empty.

ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
The first element becomes the last one.

rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
The first element becomes the last one.

rr : ra and rb at the same time.

rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.

rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.

rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
