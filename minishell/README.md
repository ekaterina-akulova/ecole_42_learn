Minishell
As beautiful as a shell

Summary:
This project is about creating a simple shell.
Yes, your own little bash.
You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT.

At the time, all developers agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned
1/0 switches was seriously irritating.

It was only logical that they came up with the idea of creating a software to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat
close to the human language.

Thanks to Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems
people faced when Windows didn’t exist.



Common Instructions

• Your project must be written in C.

• Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus
files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there
is a norm error inside.

• Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double
free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be
considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.

• All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks
will be tolerated.

• If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your
source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use
cc, and your Makefile must not relink.

• Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re.

• To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile,
which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on
the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h} if
the subject does not specify anything else. Mandatory and bonus part evaluation
is done separately.

• If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your project’s
Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.

• We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.

• Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done
after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during
Deepthought’s grading, the evaluation will stop.

Description Write a shell
Your shell should:

• Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.

• Have a working history.

• Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a
relative or an absolute path).

• Not use more than one global variable. Think about it. You will have to explain
its purpose.

• Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the
subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).

• Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.

• Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).

• Implement redirections:

◦ < should redirect input.


◦ > should redirect output.

◦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!

◦ >> should redirect output in append mode

• Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is
connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.

• Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
should expand to their values.

• Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
foreground pipeline.

• Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.

• In interactive mode:

◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.

◦ ctrl-D exits the shell.

◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.

• Your shell must implement the following builtins:

◦ echo with option -n

◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path

◦ pwd with no options

◦ export with no options

◦ unset with no options

◦ env with no options or arguments

◦ exit with no options

The readline() function can cause memory leaks. You don’t have to fix them. But
that doesn’t mean your own code, yes the code you wrote, can have memory
leaks.

You should limit yourself to the subject description. Anything that
is not asked is not required.

If you have any doubt about a requirement, take bash as a reference.

Bonus part

Your program has to implement:

• && and || with parenthesis for priorities.

• Wildcards * should work for the current working directory.

The bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is
PERFECT. Perfect means the mandatory part has been integrally done
and works without malfunctioning. If you have not passed ALL the
mandatory requirements, your bonus part will not be evaluated at al
